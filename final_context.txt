Genesis Education is a concept for creating a full-format school in a polis that incorporates principles from Finnish, Jesuit, and ancient educational systems. The school's core principles include mutual respect and shared development, personal interest of the student as the vector of education, an open space for participation of external participants, mentorship, action as a result of thought, and a continuous cycle of experience, reflection, action, and evaluation through a portfolio record and constructive feedback. The ideal for the school is a future where it serves as a model for the polis. The school is designed as a set of educational projects on the basis of its principles as a prototype for a polis of the 21st century. The nurturing of the project leaders as a prototype of the order's structure is also a part of the concept.
